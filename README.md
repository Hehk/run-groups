# Run Groups

I am doing to much next work and just want to learn something new. I am slowly setting up a new version of https://austinrungroups.com

This version is going to be a super simple MPA, and I am still learning rust so this code is probably very bad and I am using clone like a champ.

The dev deploy is at https://run-groups.vercel.app/
